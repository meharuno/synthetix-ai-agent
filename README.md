# ⚡️ synthetix-ai-agent
Synthetix is not just another AI project — we're building a real startup with a real mission:
To make AI automation accessible and profitable for small businesses, creators, and local companies.

We’re not here to play around with demos. We’re here to commercialize — to dominate the market with impact and visibility.
